# Jamboree Education - Linear Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the probability of graduate admission using linear regression. Developed for Jamboree Education, the model leverages key applicant metrics such as GRE and TOEFL scores, University Rating, Statement of Purpose & Recommendation Strength, Undergraduate GPA, and Research Experience. The goal is to identify the critical factors influencing admission decisions and provide actionable insights to improve the admission prediction feature.

## Problem Statement
Jamboree Education recently launched an online feature that estimates a student’s chances of admission into top graduate programs (IVY league colleges) from an Indian perspective. This project aims to:
- **Understand the Factors:** Determine which applicant attributes significantly influence admission chances.
- **Model Development:** Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict the probability of admission.
- **Actionable Insights:** Offer recommendations for both improving the model and guiding strategic decisions for prospective applicants and Jamboree’s feature enhancements.
